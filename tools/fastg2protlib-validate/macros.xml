                FASTG2Protlib-Peptides creates a validated protein FASTA library starting from FASTG output. The tool
                operates in two steps.

                **Generate Peptides from FASTG**
                
                Use the tool to generate peptides cleaved from putative proteins generated from a FASTG file.

                **Generate Verified Protein Library**
               
                Use the FASTG2Protlib-Validate tool to generate a verified protein library with MSGF+ verified peptides as input
